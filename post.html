                        <h2>October '19 - June '21</h2>
                        <p>Good Earth Natural Foods</p>
                        <p>This was the best high school job. I loved each task in customer service I completed. I worked with close friends of mine, and made many more along the way. I learned lots about health food and health challenges that exist in my community. I loved connecting with coworkers and customers.</p>
                        <h2>January '20 - January '21</h2>
                        <p>Rebirth Rings Graphic Design</p>
                        <p>Finally, a resume item relating to art. I consider myself a very ameteur graphic artist. I prefer a pen and paper, but my good friend offered to hire me to design some merchandise for his ring business. I enjoyed it because I was given virtually all creative freedom, and I'm proud of what I designed for this. It was a great opportunity and I hope to do more comissioned graphic art in the future.</p>
                        <h2>June '21 - July '21</h2>
                        <p>BYU creamery on Ninth</p>
                        <p>I got this job as a great transition to moving to Provo as a full time student. I especially loved serving all the excited kids who were staying at BYU for various camps. I got some great experience in fast paced grocery while looking for a longer term position on campus. I think my wrists are still sore to this day from scooping all that ice cream.</p>
                        <h2>May '22 - December '23</h2>
                        <p>Full-time missionary, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</p>
                        <p>How to put this life changing period of time into words. Let's just say I saw a variety of people experience meeting their Savior for the first time. It was a time of much growth, trial and error, and tender experience in Central Canada.</p>
                        <h2>July '21 - present</h2>
                        <p>Assistant secretary with BYU Electrical and Computer Engineering </p>
                        <p>This position has probably been the most ideal student on-campus job imaginable. With a very flexible schedule, it allows me to go back and forth between classes and studying. I get to do all kinds of different tasks, everything from helping professors with tests to complete travel expense reports. I especially love the financial aspect of this job, as it gives me great experience for my desired major.</p>

                        <h1>Education</h1>
                        <h2>'18 - '21</h2>
